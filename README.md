# Password Composer

The Password Composer gives users the possibility to remember one single
password for multiple web sites.

## Summary

Create a unique, secure password per site by hashing a Master Password
and the website domain.

## Installation

The script installs in your web browser and requires either
[Greasemonkey](http://greasespot.net) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net)
extension to work.

After installing the browser extension, browse to the Password Composer
user script [source](https://github.com/lkraider/password-composer/raw/master/password_composer.user.js)
and follow instructions.

## Compatibility

Password Composer is tested to work with:
